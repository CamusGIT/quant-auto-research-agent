"""Research Artifact example: 20-day reversal (momentum) factor.

This is the canonical example a research-code LLM should imitate. It is a
**single-file Research Artifact** that exposes an **Entry Point** callable the
Executor calls. Key points this example demonstrates (copy these patterns):

  1. Entry Point signature:  ``run(context, config) -> results``
     - function name is whatever you name it; ``compute_ref`` points to it
       (e.g. ``"assets/research-artifact-example/factor.py::run"``)
  2. ``results`` default contract: a ``dict[split_name, pd.Series]`` where each
     Series is factor exposure **already aligned** to that split panel's index.
     The Metric (ic_panel) consumes these Series; it does NOT realign.
  3. Alignment is YOUR job: build the factor on ``context.get_split(split)``
     (with ``lookback`` warmup), then ``reindex`` to the *un-lookbacked* panel
     index so only the split's rows are exposed.
  4. Write any byproducts to ``context.artifacts`` (Reflection reads them).

This factor: 20-day mean return (a short-term reversal/momentum proxy), built
from the panel's ``ret`` column, cross-sectionally usable as stock-selection
exposure. Replace the factor logic with your own; keep the Entry Point shape.
